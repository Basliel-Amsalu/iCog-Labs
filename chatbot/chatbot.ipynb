It is done by the tokenizer on the base of a mapping from tokens in the form of regular expressions to constructors of corresponding grounded atoms.\\nThe initial mapping is provided by the stdlib module, but it can be modified later. In the simple case, tokens are just strings. For example, the tokenizer is informed that if + is encountered in the course of parsing, the following atom should be constructed\\nCode snippet:\\nOperationAtom( '+' , lambda a, b: a + b,\\n[ 'Number' , 'Number' , 'Number' ])\\nHere, ['Number', 'Number', 'Number'] is a sugared way to defined the type (-> Number Number Numer) , which should also be represented as an atom.\",\n",

Atomspace is a part of the OpenCog (Hyperon) software ecosystem and it is essentially a knowledge database with the associated query engine to fetch and manipulate that knowledge. MeTTa programs can contain both factual knowledge and rules or functional code to perform reasoning on knowledge including programs themselves making the language fully self-reflective. One can draw an analogy with Prolog, which programs can also be considered as a knowledge base content, but with less introspective and more restrictive representation.\",\n",

Basic MeTTa syntax is Scheme-like, e.g. (f A) , (implies (human Socrates) (mortal Socrates)) , etc.\\n    - Variable , which is used to create patterns (expressions with variables). Such patterns can be matched against other atoms to assign some specific binding to their variables. Variables are syntactically distinguished by a leading $ , e.g. $x , $_ , $my-argument , which tells the parser to convert a symbol to a variable. Patterns could be (Parent $x $y) , (Implies (Human $x) (Mortal $x)) , (:- (And (Implies $x $y) (Fact $x)) $y) , or any other symbolic expression with variables.

Adding custom grounded atoms is a standard way for extending MeTTa and its interoperability.\\nSymbol , Variable , Grounded can be considered as nodes, while Expression can be considered as a generalized link.

Both ways can be of interest:\\n    - embedding Python objects into MeTTa for serving as sub-symbolic (and, in particular, neural) components within a symbolic system;\\n    - using MeTTa from Python for defining knowledge, rules, functions, and variables which can be referred to in Python programs to create prompt templates for LLMs, logical reasoning, or compositions of multiple AI agents.\\nWe start with the use of MeTTa from Python via high-level API, and then we will proceed to a tighter integration.\\nSetup\\n\\u200b',\n",

MeTTa itself can be built from source with Python support and installed in the development mode in accordance with the instructions in the github repository . This approach is more involved, but it will yield the latest version with a number of configuration options.\\nHowever, for a quick start, hyperon package available via pip under Linux or MacOs (possibly except for newest processors):\\nCode snippet:\\npip install hyperon\\nMeTTa runner class\\n\\u200b\\nThe main interface class for MeTTa in Python is MeTTa class, which represents a runner built on top of the interpreter to execute MeTTa programs. It can be imported from hyperon package and its instance can be created and used to run MeTTa code directly:\\nCode snippet:\\nfrom hyperon import MeTTa\\nmetta = MeTTa()\\nresult = metta.run( '''\\n(= (foo) boo)\\n! (foo)\\n! (match &self (= ($f) boo) $f)\\n''' )\\nprint (result) # [[boo], [foo]]\\nCode snippet:\",\n",

Each of this results is also a list (each containing one element in the example above). These results are not printed to the console by metta.run . They are just returned. Thus, we print them in Python.\\nLet us note that MeTTa instance preserve their program space after run has finished. Thus, run can be executed multiple times:\\nCode snippet:\\nfrom hyperon import MeTTa\\nmetta = MeTTa()\\nmetta.run( '''\\n(Parent Tom Bob)\\n(Parent Pam Bob)\\n(Parent Tom Liz)\\n(Parent Bob Ann)\\n''' )\\nprint (metta.run( '!(match &self (Parent Tom $x) $x)' )) # [[Liz, Bob]]\\nprint (metta.run( '!(match &self (Parent $x Bob) $x)' )) # [[Tom, Pam]]\\nCode snippet:\",\n",
       "  \"Parsing MeTTa code\\n\\u200b\\nThe runner has methods for parsing a program code instead of executing it. Parsing produces MeTTa atoms wrapped into Python objects (so they can be manipulated from Python). Creating a simple expression atom (A B) looks like\\nCode snippet:\\natom = metta.parse_single( '(A B)' )\\nThe parse_single() method parses only the next single token from the text program, thus the following example will give equivalent results\\nCode snippet:\\nfrom hyperon import MeTTa\\nmetta = MeTTa()\\natom1 = metta.parse_single( '(A B)' )\\natom2 = metta.parse_single( '(A B) (C D)' )\\nprint (atom1) # (A B)\\nprint (atom2) # (A B)\\nCode snippet:\\n\\nThe parse_all() method can be used to parse the whole program code given in the string and get the list of atoms\\nCode snippet:\\nfrom hyperon import MeTTa\\nmetta = MeTTa()\\nprogram = metta.parse_all( '(A B) (C D)' )\\nprint (program) # [(A B), (C D)]\\nCode snippet:\",\n",

In such cases, we can use a retrieval agent. When defining this agent, it is necessary to specify the document location or a path to one document, the chunk length for embedding creation, the desired number of chunks for the agent to return, and a designated path for storing the dataset:\\nCode snippet:\\n! ( bind! &retrieval\\n( Agent ( retrieval-agent \"text_for_retrieval.txt\" 200 2 \"data\" )))',\n",

In our case, we use ChromaDB, an open-source vector database. When the retrieval agent is invoked for a particular sentence, it first generates embeddings for the sentence and subsequently returns the closest chunks based on cosine distance metrics. For example, the text contains information about a scientist named John, then we can ask:\\nCode snippet:\\n( llm &retrieval ( user \"What is John working on?\" ))\\nHere is the usage example of a retrieval agent with ChatGPT:\\nCode snippet:\\n!

Taking this possibility into account, we have created agents in MeTTa-Motto that allow using LangChain components. LangChain is a Python framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). LangChain supports many different language models. For example, the following code uses GPT to translate text from English to French:\\nCode snippet:\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI',\n",

However, if one wants to use LLMs not directly supported by MeTTa-Motto or to use some other components of Langchain together with knowledge representation and symbolic processing capabilities provided by MeTTa, then calling Langchain functions from MeTTa can be very useful. LangChain offers a variety of useful tools. These tools serve as interfaces that an agent, chain, or LLM can use to interact with the world. We can use these tools directly from MeTTa. For example, the following script demonstrates the use of a tool designed to query arXiv , an open-access archive with 2 million scholarly articles across various scientific fields:\\nCode snippet:\\n!

( bind! np-arange ( py-atom numpy.arange )) ; ()\\n! ( np-arange 4 ) ; array([0, 1, 2, 3])\\n! ( np-arange ( Kwargs ( step 2 ) ( stop 8 ))) ; array([0, 2, 4, 6])\\n!

Atomspace is a part of the OpenCog (Hyperon) software ecosystem and it is essentially a knowledge database with the associated query engine to fetch and manipulate that knowledge. MeTTa programs can contain both factual knowledge and rules or functional code to perform reasoning on knowledge including programs themselves making the language fully self-reflective. One can draw an analogy with Prolog, which programs can also be considered as a knowledge base content, but with less introspective and more restrictive representation.\",\n",
       " 'In an Atomspace, an Atom is a fundamental building block of all the data. In the context of graph representation, an Atom can be either a node or a link. In an Atomspace as metagraph, links can connect not only nodes, but other links, that is, they connect atoms, and they can connect any number of atoms (in contrast to ordinary graphs). In MeTTa as a programming language, atoms play the role of terms.\\nIn the context of AI, Atoms can represent anything from objects, to concepts, to processes, functions or relationships. This enables the creation of rich, complex models of knowledge and reasoning.\\nAtom kinds and types\\n\\u200b\\nThere are 4 kinds of Atoms in MeTTa:\\n    - Symbol , which represents some idea or concept. Two symbols having the same name are considered equal and representing the same concept. Names of symbols can be arbitrary strings. Nearly anything can be a symbol, e.g., A , f , known? , replace-me , ≱ , etc.',\n",
       " '- Expression , which can encapsulate other atoms including other expressions. Basic MeTTa syntax is Scheme-like, e.g. (f A) , (implies (human Socrates) (mortal Socrates)) , etc.\\n    - Variable , which is used to create patterns (expressions with variables). Such patterns can be matched against other atoms to assign some specific binding to their variables. Variables are syntactically distinguished by a leading $ , e.g. $x , $_ , $my-argument , which tells the parser to convert a symbol to a variable. Patterns could be (Parent $x $y) , (Implies (Human $x) (Mortal $x)) , (:- (And (Implies $x $y) (Fact $x)) $y) , or any other symbolic expression with variables. Such patterns get meaning when they are matched against expressions in the Atomspace.',\n",
       " '- Grounded , which represents sub-symbolic data in the Atomspace. It may contain any binary object, for example operation (including deep neural networks), collection or value. Grounded value type creators can define custom type, execution and matching logic for the value. There are some grounded atoms in the standard library to deal with numbers or strings, e.g. (+ 1 2) is an expression composed of a grounded atom + , which refers to an arithmetic operation, and 1 and 2 , which are grounded atoms containing specific values. Adding custom grounded atoms is a standard way for extending MeTTa and its interoperability.\\nSymbol , Variable , Grounded can be considered as nodes, while Expression can be considered as a generalized link. This interpretation of atoms plays an important role in MeTTa applications and Hyperon as a cognitive architecture, but is not essential for understanding MeTTa as a programming language.',\n",

They are subtypes of Atom .\\nSpecial symbols\\n\\u200b\\nThere is a small number of built-in symbols which determine how a MeTTa program will be evaluated:\\n    - Equality symbol = defines evaluation rules for expressions and can be read as “can be evaluated as” or “can be reduced to”.\\n    - Colon symbol : is used for type declarations.\\n    - Arrow symbol -> defines type restrictions for evaluable expressions.\\nThese atoms are of Symbol metatype, and do not refer to particular binary objects unlike Grounded atoms, but they are processed by the interpreter in a special way.',\n",

For example, + and 1.05 will be turned into grounded atoms containing corresponding operation and value.

       "[['In an Atomspace, an Atom is a fundamental building block of all the data. In the context of graph representation, an Atom can be either a node or a link. In an Atomspace as metagraph, links can connect not only nodes, but other links, that is, they connect atoms, and they can connect any number of atoms (in contrast to ordinary graphs). In MeTTa as a programming language, atoms play the role of terms.\\nIn the context of AI, Atoms can represent anything from objects, to concepts, to processes, functions or relationships. This enables the creation of rich, complex models of knowledge and reasoning.\\nAtom kinds and types\\n\\u200b\\nThere are 4 kinds of Atoms in MeTTa:\\n    - Symbol , which represents some idea or concept. Two symbols having the same name are considered equal and representing the same concept. Names of symbols can be arbitrary strings. Nearly anything can be a symbol, e.g., A , f , known? , replace-me , ≱ , etc.',\n",
       "  \"Concrete types\\n\\u200b\\nTypes of symbols\\n\\u200b\\nAtoms in MeTTa are typed. Types of atoms are also represented as atoms (typically, symbolic atoms and expressions). Expressions of the form (: <atom> <type>) are used to assign types. For example, to designate that the symbol atom a has a custom type A one needs to add the expression (: a A) to the space (program).\\nNote that since A here is a symbol atom, it can also have a type, e.g., (: A Type) . The symbol atom Type is conventionally used in MeTTa to denote the type of type atoms. However, it is not assigned automatically. That is, declaration (: a A) doesn't force A to be of type Type .\\nWhen an atom has no assigned type, it has %Undefined% type. The value of %Undefined% type can be type-checked with any type required.\\nOne can check the type of an atom with get-type function from stdlib.\\nCode snippet:\\n( : a A )\\n( : b B )\\n( : A Type )\",\n",

       "  \"Main concepts\\n\\u200b\\nAtoms and knowledge graphs\\n\\u200b\\nMeTTa (Meta Type Talk) is a multi-paradigm language for declarative and functional computations over knowledge (meta)graphs.\\nEvery MeTTa program lives inside of a particular Atomspace (or just Space if we don't insist on a particular internal representation). Atomspace is a part of the OpenCog (Hyperon) software ecosystem and it is essentially a knowledge database with the associated query engine to fetch and manipulate that knowledge. MeTTa programs can contain both factual knowledge and rules or functional code to perform reasoning on knowledge including programs themselves making the language fully self-reflective. One can draw an analogy with Prolog, which programs can also be considered as a knowledge base content, but with less introspective and more restrictive representation.\",\n",

The tutorial starts with introducing four kinds of atoms - Symbol , Expression , Variable , Grounded . We refer to them as metatypes .
